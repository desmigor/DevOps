# Terraform

## 0. Terraform Good Practices
- Split configuration into several files
- Organize files by workspaces in first-level directories and by projects in the second-level directories
- Use `variables.tf` for tokens' security
- Using `teraform fmt` to check if the files are correctly formated
- Using `terraform validate` to check the validity of the terraform code

## 1. Docker steps and output

### 1.1 Installing Terraform and building infrastructure

<br>

From the directory where the `main.tf` is located, I used the command:

```
terraform apply
```

To view the built infrastructure, I used the commands below:

```
terraform show
```
Output: 

```

Created Repository link: [View here](https://github.com/desmigor/new-terraform-repository)

### 2.2 Importing existing repository.

I imported the labs repository using:

```
terraform import "github_repository.devops-labs-terraform" "devops-labs" 
````

Checking the new state:
```
 terraform state list
```

output:
```
github_branch_default.main
github_branch_protection.default
github_repository.devops-labs-terraform
github_repository.repo
```
