# 1. Flask Best practices
- Use Production ready web-framework - `Flask`
- Use popular python linter - `pylint`
- List all dependencies and their version for reproducible builds - detailed in `requirements.txt`
- Run production WSGI server (Gunicorm) instead of Flask dev server
- Allow to configure the app using environment variables, as recommended by the  twelve factor app
- Containerize application using Docker containers
- Use Jinja templates instead of hardcoding html strings in the source code
- Include .gitignore for skipping irrelevant files in the Git VCS
- Include .dockerignore for reducing docker context size

# 2. Framework
This application is built using Flask.

## 2.1 Why this framework
## 2.2 Pros & Cons of the framework
## Pros
- &#9989;&nbsp; Highly Scalable <br />
>The reason behind the scalable nature of Flask is its ability to modularize the codebase as it grows over a specific period. It allows developers to segregate them as chucks.

- &#9989;&nbsp; Easy to Use and Flexible
> the framework is straightforward to use and understand, even for a newbie. The primary reason behind the simplicity of Flask is its documentation that becomes handy for developers in case of confusion.

- &#9989;&nbsp; Greater Control Over Codes
>The framework enables developers to choose the components they want for a specific application. Moreover, Flask empowers developers to make decisions while selecting the components for development.

- &#9989;&nbsp; Support for Testing
>Flask provides an in-built unit testing facility that enables you to test your app before making it live in production. In addition, the framework provides features such as a built-in development server, a fast debugger, and restful request dispatching.

- &#9989;&nbsp; Facilitates Experimentation
>Flask enables you to adapt to emerging technologies and work through agile development methodologies. Faster implementation is one of the USPs of the Flask framework, and thatâ€™s why it made its name among the Python community.

## Cons 
- &#10062;&nbsp; More potential for security risks
- &#10062;&nbsp; Slower MVP development in most cases
- &#10062;&nbsp; Higher maintenance costs for more complex systems
- &#10062;&nbsp; More complicated maintenance for larger implementations

# 3. Unit tests best practices

- Use popular testing framework (e.g. pytest)
- Use fixtures to create dependencies
- Use `conftest.py` for all fixtures
